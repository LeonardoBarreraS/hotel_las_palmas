 Check in is always incredibly slow and the staff can be frustrating This hotel is quite faded and a little out of context in this shiny new area I always ask for a smaller double bed as in the larger rooms it is twin beds joined together which I find really uncomfortable My last visit meant changing rooms three times It was annoying to be moved to a room with exactly the same issue and to take over 30 minutes to get into a room I ve also lost clothing there and despite e mails and me going there it was never recovered which is very poor The air conditioning doesn t work well in some rooms and the DLR sounds can be very noisy at night ,NEGATIVE

 Day 1 I noticed that the hotel didnt actually offer shampoo asked the front desk and they were not very useful as i guess the hotel just doeant have any My rooms safe was also broken from day 1 Day 2 I had noticed a few things dodnt get cleaned at all in the room Day 3 On my third night I went to sleep early for my early train out of town and ended up waking up to some sort of dance party in the room next door at 1AM I called the front desk around 1 05 and then 15 minutes later someone knocked on the door and the party moved down the hall Only far enough to quiet down for me to go to sleep I could still hear them from down the hall but was beyond my concern at that point Upon checkout the hotel staff asked about my stay and were apathetuc to my complaints ,NEGATIVE

 Nothing ,NEGATIVE
 I know I booked a budget room but I didn t realize rooms without windows even existed anymore but that s what I got Nor did it have air conditioning Just a fan The daytime temperatures were about 30 degrees so I had two uncomfortable nights Had I known all this in advance I probably would have paid more for something better or an Airbnb I actually dreamed about being on holiday in North Korea It was that good My other gripe was the length of time it took to get a beer Short queues at the bar took forever to get to the front of mainly because people were buying huge rounds of drinks The bar girl did her best but the odds were stacked against her More bar staff might be an idea Plenty of people without my determination and unquenchable thirst gave up and I don t blame them My third and final gripe is the external camouflage of the hotel which is labelled the P Hotel outside with no obvious clue as to its claimed name of Britannia International For a non London dweller like me simple things like this matter quite a lot when I am hot and tired and lost ,NEGATIVE
 Having to pay extra for use of pool guests should swim free Room view was of generator ,NEGATIVE

 The rooms were Okay Just like in the picture Bit dark in decor My son remarked no toothpaste no hairdryer and I was disappointed to find no tea or coffee in the rooms just bottled water Maybe that was because we had the lowest priced room ,NEGATIVE
 My stay at this hotel was a nightmare I checked in at 9 00 PM and was taken to a room in which there was hair on the duvet sheets and pillows on each of the two single beds I politely complained to the staff at the front desk and was taken to another room Unfortunately there was hair all over that bed as well I then complained once more and was given a so called suite in the annex across the street This room was dingy and there was a lot of noise coming from an adjacent room but the sheets were at least clean and I was able to fall asleep with ear plugs ,NEGATIVE

 Many upsetting events that made this hotel stay a nightmare My fiancee and I booked several rooms for us and our family as we were holding our wedding in London I do not recommend you to stay there 1 Very unprofessional welcome Porter stood there watching us as we exited our taxi with tons of luggage without any offer from help from any of the staff from arrival till we reached the lobby 2 We entered our room to discover it barely had any window This was made more horrendous as we told the lobbyist we were staying at the hotel as we were getting married in London that weekend The person at the lobby didn t even care The only thing we could do is pay an extra 90GBP per night to get a decent room with decent lighting 3 Our room was supposed to be cancellable modifiable up to 24h in advance We had tried to modify our booking a week before arriving as we had to shorten our stay from 4 nights to 3 nights Instead of cancelling one night for free as they advertised the online booking wouldn t cancel one night under the excuse that there is no space available which makes no sense since I was just cancelling a night under the booking that I HAD They made us rebook the entire stay so 3 nights at a much higher price around 40 more expensive Multiply that by 4 4 rooms and the bill goes up significantly 4 The cleaner came in while we were in the room and instead of properly cleaning changing the drinking glasses in the room she just wiped them with a cloth with no washing God knows how many people have had a drink from that glass There was also hair in almost every towel in the bathroom 5 The hotel mistakenly cancelled the room of a family member and we had to waste 30 min for them to find the booking again CONCLUSION DO NOT STAY THERE IT S OVERPRICED and the level of service is worthy of a 2 star hotel on top of the rip off with the booking modification ,NEGATIVE

 Nothing can be done about this but it was very difficult dealing with non native English speaking housekeeping staff We didn t have facecloths in our room and when I first mentioned it to the Front Desk in the evening because the housekeeping staff had left the fellow who brought me over something brought me towels and said he didn t know where the facecloths were I attempted again the second day to get facecloths and eventually got them but after I got them every day when housekeeping was done they were never replenished for the 5 days of our stay even though everything else was Is it unusual to have facecloths along with bath and hand towels in London Also the letter about the club service needs to be updated The letter said we could get breakfast in the lounge until 11 00 a m but when I inquired at the Front Desk they said the lounge was only available from 6 9 p m Also coming from a scent free environment I found the product used on the carpet in our building very strong ,NEGATIVE

 The room was so small it was impossible for two grown adults to move around in comfortably It was more suited to a single room and bed Very uncomfortable and almost claustrophobic We were with friends and almost impossible to all squeeze in to share a drink following our night out We managed in the morning with one staying in bed until the other had finished washing and dressing we felt that it was very overcharged for the size of room On checking out I told the Receptionist how we felt and was horrified to see she was laughing I told her that I did not find it funny and if the guest was making a complaint the least she could do was acknowledge it Disgusted I said I would not recommend or stay here again ,NEGATIVE

 Several key points to improve 1 Noise of cleaning people during the early part of the day 2 cleanness of rooms and replenishment of supplies are poor 3 Room allocation is not suitable and very little room for flexibility despite prior arrangement and promises by front desk staff 4 Staff can be more friendly and caring listen to the customer 5 Gym equipment needs attention to avoid injures liability issue 6 TV has limited channels 7 Rooms near corridors suffer from the noise of the double swing doors 8 Bathrooms can use some uplift and maintenance 9 No view was on the 7th floor and was upgraded to the 2nd floor with back side roof view ,NEGATIVE
 Front desk manager on high level as well as two of young Staff Transport to airport well organized ,POSITIVE

 Staff decorated our room prior to arrival as a surprise for my other half on our anniversary they also supplied us with a bottle of champagne Excellent service highly recommended ,POSITIVE
 Wi Fi should really be free of charge,NEGATIVE
 Elevator You need to wait 5 10 Min its too long,NEGATIVE
 The fact that wifi is not complementary Also I asked if I could check out 1 hour later and they asked for extra 10 GBP Short sighted when they see me in their hotel every other week,NEGATIVE
 Asked for a city view room got one the opposite way facing builders who began working very early in the morning Parking for 2 x night was 24 pound which was ridiculous and the shutter was always open No wifi Overall not a nice experience for mine and my partners 1st anniversary ,NEGATIVE

 Gym and leisure facilities were lovely,POSITIVE
 Despite being on the menu there was no hash browns for breakfast although this was substituted by normal potatoes which was acceptable Unfortunately all of the breakfast was stone cold The wifi connection was fiddly and constantly kept dropping out There was building work in the hotel and what seemed like a constant heavy drilling for most of the day time which was annoying The double bed was two mattresses pushed together which gave an uncomfortable ridge in the centre of the bed ,NEGATIVE
 We really liked breakfast rooms and design in all hotel very friendly staff ,POSITIVE
 When we arrived the staff dealt with people as quickly as possible and showed you to your room which was nice because the hotel was rather big We also had a fridge and a microwave in our room which is handy to put a pint of milk in to chill The beds were nice and comfy and the shower was amazing It was basically a home from home The check in and out times were good as it meant you could relax in the morning without being forced out the door I would definitely stay here again Such a nice experience We were a bit sceptical after the reviews but I am so glad we ignored them now ,POSITIVE
 As previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for London this is probably typical Upgrading to a Club room provides access to the Club Lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station Breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price ,POSITIVE

 I had a rather frustrating experience I booked the room because it came with a guaranteed view and a bathtub in reality the room looked out onto another building through dirty windows So I complained and the staff tried to be helpful upgrading me to a room with a view of the river I was so pleased until I actually got inside the room It was a family room and had two double beds in it and wasn t cosy or nice at all For a romantic getaway with my boyfriend it just all felt so wrong The bath drain didn t work so we couldn t have a bath And the toilet didn t flush properly It was supposed to be a special night away for us an anniversary and birthday celebration and ended up being rather a let down in terms of the room and facilities etc I had also called ahead twice to stress that it was a special occasion confirm that I would have a view of the river and ask for some wine glasses to be in the room which I was assured I would get and never got When I checked in I asked again and still never got wine glasses Which is just freaking annoying ,NEGATIVE

 Staff originally made a mistake by putting us in a standard room when we booked a superior Air conditioning only worked on hot due to it being October yet the room was too hot and with the windows open the cockerels in the garden woke us up at about 1am and kept going throughout the early hours This may not have been a problem if the windows weren t open but it was too hot to sleep with them closed ,NEGATIVE

 I was really worried about taking the car into London and where to park When we arrived at Copthorne Tara Hotel in the early evening it was a breeze Drove straight into their well lit basement car park and found several available spaces A stairwell is available from the car park to the reception We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff Our club room was on the 10th floor Very clean and comfortable bed As we could access the Club Lounge we managed to avoid the long queue at breakfast and be in a more quiet setting Lovely breakfast with lots of choice and very attentive staff The location of this Hotel is within easy walking distance to museums and the Royal Albert Hall Would definitely book again ,POSITIVE

 Checking in the receptionist needed help from a colleague and then couldn t find my Hilton Honors account despite me giving her the number She seemed generally bored and not too interested in welcoming guests In an Executive room for 2 people we had one bathrobe Called housekeeping 3 times before I could get through and general reception twice always engaged Said they would bring one up Never did The lamp next to my bed wasn t working as the bulb had gone As it was around 10 30pm and after the fiasco with the bathrobe didn t seem worth bothering to try and get this sorted out In the bathroom out of 2 bath sheets one was new and fluffy and one old and worn odd to leave two such disparate towels and so obvious one was ready for throwing out This stay was disappointing especially as it was a treat for a friends birthday and It felt like no one had an eye on the fine detail I expect better at 175 a night ,NEGATIVE
 The system in the hotel kept crashing down we heard it every day from staff Consequently the wifi wasn t working in the rooms We had recurring issues with the card keys to enter the room Sauna wasn t working the spa part is very badly maintained and the water in the pool is not warm There are no bathrobes in the room to go to the spa need to be ordered from front desk Standard or premium room have view to the inside wall with zero daylight It s an enormous hotel with no personality and rather unfriendly staff On top they do not accept payments with debit cards ,NEGATIVE

 Although we did get an upgrade on arrival from a room with no window to one with a window the beds were too hard and the noise from outside consistently noisy through the night which meant we did not get hardly any sleep We paid for breakfast at the hotel as it wasn t in our room rate it was very expensive 13 50 each and the quality of the food and the service was poor We would not stay at this hotel again or recommend it to anyone else ,NEGATIVE

 We was supposed to have a suite for 4 adults but what we received it was a king bed and a smal sofa bed that two of us should sleep on it It was narrow and very uncomfortable All over the room even in bathrooms was lots of ants moving We was afraid to have them on our bed The guy on reception told its like this because we are beside a park Two huge ruin buildings was adjacent to the hotel building cause us feels like we are living in ruins of world war ,NEGATIVE

 We was placed into the new part of the hotel which felt far to small and didn t feel like i was in the Britannia we stayed there previous for a lower rate but had a lovely room however this time we was charged a 20 fee to change room But we found out later after having a drink with another couple in the bar that they paid for exactly same room as we did but was upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi free of charge This was very upsetting as I don t think we was treated fairly When I questioned it with the hotel staff I was told there was nothing they could do and didn t even have time to care for us or maybe just offer us out 20 refund back It s a shame as we always choose to come here We was told that the hotel is under new management and they don t offer different rooms anymore but yet I knew otherwise as the other couple we met confirmed that the staff was lying To us The breakfast wasn t as nice as before either very dry and bad quality Wasn t worth paying 10 each We went there with the intention of staying for 2 nights but chose to stay else where after being treated unfair we opted for the Hilton next door ,NEGATIVE
 Very hard to find the hotel without sat nav Not a very nice area nowhere to walk outside ,NEGATIVE
 They charge for wireless What is the cost of this to a 4 star hotel at this time and age I think a hotel providing only 20 mins wireless connection as a room service is a big shame in 2017 Their heater did not work either during my stay People are nice but facilities are very limited This hotel does not deserve 4 stars ,NEGATIVE

 The room The first room I walked into smelt like someone had been smoking in there The carpet had stains all over it and the bathroom was basic nothing like the pictures make it look like The wooden TV cabinet and the like had mug stains all over them and were very unappealing The deal breaker for me was the seamen stain on the corner of one of the bed bases I walked down and asked for a refund and to go elsewhere As this was booked through booking com they could not do this They upgraded me to a satisfactory room which still looked outdated The only nice thing was the bathroom in this one My room was also only made up on one of the 3 days I stayed despite leaving a make me up sign on the outside of the door Wouldn t stay again Ever The rating on booking com swayed me to book this place Next time I ll do more research ,NEGATIVE

 The room was nothing like the advert that enticed me to go ahead and book Not sure how it could be charged or called an executive room We would have expected chairs not taking turns to sit on the one available which was really uncomfortable The room was drab again nothing like your advert it was not worth the money at all we would not like to have seen a standard room if this was the quality of Executive The window casement was broken and so the top part of the window kept slipping down safety sign a bit ironic really We would not recommend these rooms to anyone who is planning to spend any time in the hotel better off sitting in the foyer ,NEGATIVE

 Location ,POSITIVE
 Having to pay for the pool when it is already part of the hotel that your staying in is ridiculous not that I mind paying but 10 per person every time you would like to use it is a bit much And then you can only use half the pool because there is swimming lessons going on and then they decide to close the jacuzzi after we waited for 2 hours to use it Food is way overpriced as is the alcohol 8 for a small glass of wine restaurants we had been in in London didn t even charge that Asked hotel could we borrow an umbrella as the rain was heavy on that day and there was also a charge for that of 6 ,NEGATIVE

 The only thing I would have to say that really disappointed me was the bed During mine my friend s stay on 5th June 2015 the bed was like a dream one of those mattresses you lay down on just sink into However during this time around s stay the mattress was less than satisfactory extremely disappointing I sat down on the bed upon entering the room immediately noticed the difference as did my friend We both ended up not being able to sleep properly during our stay on 10th July 2016 due to not being able to get comfortable as the mattress was too hard to be able to get comfortable on we both ended up with our shoulders back hurting when we checked out the next day Please please change back to the mattress supplier you were using during 2015 ,NEGATIVE

 Was really frustrated on Monday evening when we tried to go to the sky bar on the 17th floor for a drink around 10pm to be told it was closed when we arrived we were then advised that there were bars on 1st or ground floor Then when we went down to the 1st floor bar the staff there advised it was closed and escorted us to the ground floor Where we finally got a drink ,NEGATIVE
 The hotel lobby and bar areas are very nice It s an old historic hotel The standard rooms are very basic and you the walls are thin It s a no frills sleeping room with no decor The bed linens were old and they didn t use a top sheet just a top comforter that we all know rarely gets washed I turned the lights on several times in the night to ensure there were no bedbugs The bathroom was outdated and very tight space I had to squeeze near the toilet before I could even shut the bathroom door to get to the sink I would never stay here again ,NEGATIVE

 Unfortunately when we arrived to check in we were told that we were being moved to a sister hotel the Paddingtond Grand on the far side of Hyde Park It was said that it was because of problems with plumbing in our original room This was well outside the Kensington area where we needed to be Contrary to what reception staff told us I have no evidence that any attempt was made to inform us beforehand There was no practical possibility of making alternative arrangements A taxi service was available but this inevitably took time We found this to be exceptionally poor service which distrupted our weekend It was clear that we could have been informed beforehand that the hotel was not available but were presented with a fait accompli which put our requirements far down the list of their priorities ,NEGATIVE

 poor service by reception did not record that we had ordered breakfast or morning newspapers did not record that we had recorded a credit card for extra items whilst on our stay this caused embarrisment with bar staff who insisted that we had to pay as we went along this was resolved but should not have been necessary also room maid cleaned room whilst we were at breakfast and had not put sign out to clean room also took ages to prepare decafinated coffee at breakfast and also took ages to serve irish coffee after evening meal all small things but as they say many mole hills turn into mountains ,NEGATIVE

 Hotel carpark was very difficult to get into and my husband curbed his alloy wheels on his very new car I tried to cancel my booking for 2 rooms 5 minutes after making it I was told that I would still have to pay as it was less than 24 hours before we were due to arrive So they would only charge for one room I said we would still honour the booking and go after all I was still charged for the cancellation although it was eventually sorted out They said as a good will gesture they wouldn t charge me for the cancellation When I hadn t cancelled after all this was more than a little annoying Especially after ruining the alloy wheels in the car park ,NEGATIVE
 The reception staffs when I did check put they was angry and they spoke with me un politely that I should pay 60 because I m late while the one before her sheft told me 40 They keep me waiting for 45 minutes I left with out bill because they was very slow If anyone from Head Hilton Hotels want there name I wrote all the information in my note book This is the last time with those chilli staff ,NEGATIVE

 No thing,NEGATIVE
 On arrival we were greeted kindly and reassured the wait for reception would be as short as possible by the concierge however as he then directed us to a free receptionist another traveler obviously with little manners walked straight into the Hotel and up to the desk we again waited for a free assistant the concierge again offered us forward the receptionist then answered the phone and we had to wait a while longer I find this extremely rude and unprofessional and believe that a physically present human being should always without exception be dealt with first and foremost ,NEGATIVE

 My advice is to book a hotel that costs half the price as you will get the same standard This hotel is definitely NOT worth the room rates they charge Where can I start We stayed in the East wing cannot rate the other wing 1 East Wing lifts dont really work especially in the morning waited 10 minutes then got stuck then the doors wouldn t open when we reached the floor when we finally managed to exit the lift there was no stairs alternative only the fire escape which lead into the backroom of the hotel bar when reporting the problems with the lifts we were told they work fine and only busy due to many people going to breakfast 2 No water pressure in the shower 3 Both shower and sink taps gave either boiling hot water or cold no in between 4 The room was freezing when you entered from the hallway it was like stepping outside in winter I reported this and tried to turn it off or set to warm instead but to no avail When requesting a blanket as none were in the room I was told they would not provide us with one They offered a couple of extra sheets after I kept insisting it was too cold to sleep but never showed up not until i rang the third time after one hour threatening to go down to the reception and create a scene 5 Both the room and the bathroom were extremely outdated and shabby ,NEGATIVE

 I made a special request for a room on a low floor for medical reasons and asked the person on reservations if this could be guaranteed to let me know in advance When I arrived the room was on the 3rd floor and after about an hour wait I eventually got one on the 2nd floor I asked to speak to the duty manager and he said I could move to first floor the next day but no apology for the inconvenience and made a few useless comments like when I said I met the housekeeper and asked if there was free rooms on the first floor and she yes This manager told me SHE would have no idea what rooms were available on any floor make sense NO Another point is the food the same menu is now used in restaurant bar and room service and it is a very limited menu and as a vegetarian I found it not cater at all and for the quality of the food it is not cheap I stayed there several times when it was just Kensington Close Hotel and never had any complaints but now that it s owned by the group Holiday Inn I would have my doubts about booking there again which for me is a pity as I like the area very much and find it easy to see the sights etc from there A small point the tissue box had about 2 tissues when we checked in which we used straight away the empty box was not replaced even though I took the box out of the silver container so housekeeping would know to replace but no stayed 3 nights and this not replaced The standard rooms are quiet small and the bathrooms even smaller but having stayed previously we knew this and not a problem To finish Holiday Inn please note clients special requests and even though these cannot be quaranteed it would be good if they were at least read by reservations and make contact if needs be For me the fact this important request was overlooked ruined the leisure break I was looking for,NEGATIVE
 THE STAFF WERE VERY HELPFUL AND OBLIGING ,POSITIVE

 Rooms are a little small and the bathrooms even smaller and the prices suddenly shoot up for not apparent reason and in my case where I am not sure how many days I have to stay so could not commit to a package this forced me to move down the road I have stayed at this hotel on and off for many years even from when it was called the Great Western but including an extended period in January February 2015 This has never been recognised ,NEGATIVE
 Breakfast starts too late paid for it but couldn t take it ,NEGATIVE
 Noisy room even though we requested a quiet one No good eateries around the area We booked at the Park Grand Kensington as we had several events and chores to do around the area that could be done either by walking or a couple of tube stops max When we got there only they informed us they were doing some maintenance work and they will locate us to a sister hotel which was in Paddington nightmare All our trips took at least 30 45min extra and had to use lots of taxis which is enormously expensive We said we didn t want another area and all what they said was sorry we tried to inform our customers This is not true as I did the booking on March 3 and I think they had enough time to inform us of this If they told us that before hand we could ve either cancelled as we had free cancellation until 1 day prior to arrival or used the Heathrow express to reach Paddington rather than paying a ridiculously high taxi fare from the airport to Kensington then jump on the free taxi they provided to the other hotel as a reward They also provided us with breakfast but it wasn t of any interest This was done extremely unprofessionally and I would advise you to confirm with the hotel before booking there ,NEGATIVE

 The hairdryer was broken but luckily I d brought one when you lifted it up from it s holder the front end was detached leaving all the heat elements exposed Also the kettle didn t switch off meaning the button and handle became extremely hot if not caught in time other than that it was great ,NEGATIVE
 The location was terrible 4 stops on the train outside of Milan but also literally a rose between two thorns as the two building next door were derelict The train station is literally next door so that is convenient but the last train back is before 11pm so restricts what you can do at night A taxi into the centre or Milan Expo is nearly 30 E No facilities for such a big hotel For a 4 Star Hotel you would expect at least a swimming pool ,NEGATIVE

 At check in i was delighted to see the Spices Indian Restaurant and immediately made dinner plans The restaurant was very quiet and i perhaps i discovered why I ordered a glass of what purported to be Rioja and indeed it might have been but tasted like it came from a bottle which had been left half empty for days or longer On sending it back as off the waiter clearly disagreed with me but agreed to bring me a Shiraz instead which tasted remarkably similar to the supposed Rioja and similarly off So i reverted to beer and waited for the food To be fair the Masala Fish starter was ok However the lamb rogan reminded me of some sort of re constituted packet meal from the 1980s The type of meat i m assuming it was meat was indeterminate there was no evidence of spicy hotness and it was accompanied by a Peshwari Nan which had a vague sprinkling of something resembling desiccated coconut but nothing else It was without doubt one of the worst culinary experiences of my life My advice stay at the hotel but avoid the Indian restaurant ,NEGATIVE

 All small stuff here but things to take note 1 Some of the tech is overkill and has glitches when you just need to simply hit the lights off but this area Shoreditch is known for being a tech hub so its understandable what they are trying to do 2 Also alarm in spa kept going off because they had i big red button in the steam room that people kept pressing thinking it would create more steam Terrible design and I m sure its going to get fixed after the incident 3 Construction is taking place next door so depending on the room it can be noisy 4 Not the hotels fault but there were some rude snobby guests It seems to attract a crowd that thinks they are much cooler than they really are 5 Not really much of a view or open light Windows were slivers but that said it didn t seem to intrude on the comfort and feel of the space ,NEGATIVE

 The hotel is 15 minute walking distance from a metro station which will seem far after a day of visiting when you are exhausted The area is far away from the city so if you want to get something to eat at night good luck You will not feel you are in Milan but somewhere near Milan from where you commute daily The rooms were very NOISY The windows were very badly soundproof so it was the same if they were open or closed Same for the entrance door I always heard everything that happened on the hallway loud and clear Plus my room was next to the elevator Great The thing that bothered me the most is that they blocked 200 euros from my card when I got there and now two days after I got back the money is still blocked Unacceptable Another horrible thing was the temperature it was very cold and the heating didn t work The temperature we set on the thermostat made no difference on the actual room temperature We kind of froze a little Thank God it was spring Also I don t get it how they are rated 4 stars They have no facilities at all no pool gym etc I would not stay here again nor recommend anyone to do so People if you want to get a real feel of Milan stay at the hotel in the city not in the countryside You ll want to get a shower after a day of walking around and then go get dinner Better take a three star hotel in the heart of the city if you re budget conscientious than daVinci You ll spend more money on night taxis otherwise anyway ,NEGATIVE

 There was a confusion with room service and our door number and our pizza and sandwhich s took over an hour to reach us so when it did it was cold We requested a taxi to be called from reception they said the earliest any taxi could get here was a 45 minute wait when we had somewhere to be We requested on the phone please could you call us if it arrives early we will come down 10 minutes before it s due We waited and no taxi came We then had to que for a further 10 minutes to speak with reception who did not take any responsibility and we explained that we needed to be somewhere and we were made to feel in the wrong A lovely taxi driver picked us up and explained there was not a 45 minute wait on taxi s Leaving us to miss part of our venue and feel very disappointed with the service ,NEGATIVE

 The bed was hopeless I thought it was just my room but I soon found out that my sons room also had the same problem with the bed Too soft and you will sink into it My wife and me suffered from severe back pain sleeping on it Im willing to bet most of the rooms have the same bed condition We complained and the staff said he will look into it and give us another room But he soon disappeared and when we met him later in the lobby he just smile and said hello like we never complained at all Rooms have been already charged and there is no such thing as cancelling and getting your refund back We knew the terms so complaining wouldnt help Continental Bfast is included in the package and if you want a full English bfast pay an extra GBP5 I do not understand why they need to do this as it creates a negative impression among customers and I have heard many of them whispering about this scam like technique around the tables Honestly do not take the bfast option as you will be left very very disappointed Its not worth the money at all There are other places nearby offering a hearthy hot bfast for GBP5 only Save you a pile of money For the money you spend here there are many other hotels nearby which do not charge as much and have much much more comfortable beds All the hotels in London brag about walking distances to restaurants and public transportation I believe that this hotel has quite a distance to go to the tube and the restaurants around Bayswater as compared to the others I would not recommend to others to stay here Stay around Paddington area is much better ,NEGATIVE
 Big queue for table at breakfast,NEGATIVE
 It was raining ,NEGATIVE
 book the club room which didn t feel like one The first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held 2 separate rooms The room was not well furnished despite the price paid One side of the mattress has collapsed I called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long 15mins before I could address the change of my room I was told that it was the last room and I can t make any changes I was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap When I came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night Thank god for the curtains The room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint I was too tired and upset to even request for another room change ,NEGATIVE

 Firstly the car park has tiny spaces and difficult to manoeuvre around with many cars parking across two spaces do they pay double I wonder There is no lift from the car park to reception so you walk down a dingy corridor with hanging pipes and cables through doors with chipped paint and up about 20 steps struggling with luggage to reception Here you wait in a queue for about ten minutes to check in because guess what only three of the six check in desks are manned and a coach load of tourists has just beaten you to check in We ask a bored looking concierge if there is somewhere for our 82 year old disabled mother to sit whilst we get our key and are directed to a few stools in an area cordoned off by a red rope which he makes no attempt to move for us so we can gain access so we move it ourselves We finally check in but only after having to give again exactly the same information that we had given when making the original booking We were then asked what time we were checking out on our leaving day Not soon enough I was tempted to reply and we had only been here about half an hour We were due to go to a show at the Albert Hall so back to our friendly concierge once again but he said he didn t know where the Albert Hall was but asked an equally bored looking colleague who muttered it would be five minutes by cab My faith would have been lifted a little if he has said brightly Let me know what time you wish to leave sir and I will hail a cab for your party but I suppose we can only dream We had booked two rooms together so we re not really surprised when one was on the first floor and the other on the fifth The rooms were clean but basic with ultra thin pillows no choice of pillow like Premier Inn and the narrowest double bed I have seen in a hotel for a good many years now and we have been to quite a few We decided to eat at the Brasserie before going to our show ,NEGATIVE
 The breakfast service,POSITIVE
 Window in the room was broken as the room directly overlooked the ventilation system it was quite noisy We were not offered another room but maintenance said a new lock was needed and that could not be done that day so they taped the window shut with gaffer tape not ideal for a good night s sleep ,NEGATIVE

 Although room comfy aircon was noisy and as we had fab weather it needed to be on There are no opening windows safety I suppose May be a little far out of the city for those that are less mobile and struggle with public transport although we had no problems getting a taxi we paid 20 to get close to city centre and 30 to get back from the Shard ,NEGATIVE
 Room exceptionally small and could be construed as dangerous Room was in a very confined space with 10 steep steps down to a miniscule bathroom with only just enough to squeeze in and I am of reasonably small build ,NEGATIVE
 Nothing to not like,NEGATIVE
 The mess of all the take away litter left in the lounge late at night which was obviously bought from the restaurant was an eyesore ,NEGATIVE

 Good quality room free parking nice lobby ,POSITIVE
 Having a bath in my room ,POSITIVE
 The service was excellence the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on even though the tablets by the bed were a bit temperamental and would switch off randomly a guy from maintenance instantly came to sort it out The view of London from your location was amazing ,POSITIVE
 The room was very much smaller than I anticipated It must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as I checked in I had expected to have a small living area and that was why I booked this particular hotel as I did not want a traditional hotel room I did not get that ,NEGATIVE
 It was a comfortable stay nice room and bathroom Many outlets bars and restaurants nearby which was very convenient ,POSITIVE
 It was a perfect hotel,POSITIVE
 Such a small room A double bed instead of king size would have given us more much need floor space ,NEGATIVE
 The tiny room had a microwave and fridge built into a cupboard but with no space for a chair to sit and eat We found the bed too soft for us ,NEGATIVE
 The bed mattress was old and sagged in the middle not good for my back and 3 uncomfortable nights of restless sleep I prefer a firm bed and the pillows were too thick so bad for my neck ,NEGATIVE

 Nice location and the room was comfy good nespresso machine mini bar etc plus fancy ipad controlled everything ,POSITIVE
 The location was great The food was nice and the staff were helpful ,POSITIVE
 Without exaggeration I didn t think a hotel could ever create a room smaller than a cruise ship but the rooms are incredibly small A double bed is smaller than a US Full size and there is only room to walk up to the bed on one side Although the finishes are new and luxurious I ve had more room to move about when tent camping Only one small stool to sit on and no place for suitcases We were tripping into each other during our entire stay The bathrooms were modern and recently remodeled with high end finishes but so small that actually hard to use both the toilet and the shower Also the drains did not work properly in both rooms we had so sinks and shower filled up during use Our first room was on the Third floor which is actually 4 flights up with NO Elevator The staff was very accommodating to give us a room accessible by elevator on the second day This was the most expensive hotel of our European vacation far exceeding Madrid Barcelona and Ireland in price It s a very old building which has been re done as a hotel The location was pretty good and London hotels are very expensive Just be aware of the pros and cons before booking READ other reviews and when they say SMALL rooms know that they are tiny ,NEGATIVE
 Location was perfect The pool and spa facilities were top notch and the evening entertainment perfected our day in the big city,POSITIVE
 Staff were extremely helpful and friendly,POSITIVE

 location Close to tube Breakfast good ,POSITIVE
 The buffet breakfast was amazing Highly recommended but go early Close to both Edgware Road tube station and a pick up drop off bus stop for several London bus tour companies i e Golden Tours 10 15 minute walk to Marble Arc and Oxford Street for shopping They did offer luggage storage until your room was ready don t expect to get in early Spacious room Housekeeping was very prompt ,POSITIVE
 The room was very tired looking and needs to be updated expected a lot more for a four star hotel The receptionist never said where the breakfast room was or evening meals didn t promote the fact you could eat at the hotel Breakfast was average wasn t worth the money I paid Was disappointed with the amount of money I paid ,NEGATIVE
 Bed was really comfy and the room was huge Never had so much space in a hotel room Getting breakfast included for our room was a lovely bonus and access to the millennium club room on the sixth floor was brilliant ,POSITIVE
 I ve stayed in this hotel 2 or 3 nights a week for the last 5 weeks whilst working in London and will stay again in future I agree with others that the rooms are a little dated but they are clean comfortable and a good size for central London It is within walking distance of 3 DLR stations I haven t eaten in the main restaurant but the pizzeria is reasonably good Room service is good but there is a 5 delivery charge There is a well equipped gym with swimming pool on site for a small charge ,POSITIVE
 We were on 10th floor overlooking a very busy rail network so light sleepers would have possibly found this an issue we slept like logs however and in any case there are plenty of rooms that face over the river so we would choose one of those next time It s a quiet part of Southbank at Lambeth compared with only a bit further up the road towards the London Eye so all in all location was one of its very major benefits ,POSITIVE
 I spent the weekend here with my partner the hotel was clean and staff were extremely friendly Hotel facilities were great and the location of the hotel was ideal as there were a variety of transport options to get you to and from the centre of London We particularly liked the complimentary ferry link between the hotel and canary wharf We had an excellent trip to London and will definitely use this hotel again and recommend it to family and friends too ,POSITIVE

 Executive room was large enough with double bed and seating area ,POSITIVE
 The room was hideously small I reserved a standard single after staying in it for 3 days I m sure room 721 is a cosy single That s the hotel s code for a single room which is just slightly larger than a closet The elevated shower you have to climb up into it is tiny a bit of a hazard One slip on soap or water you will fall out of the shower down onto the sink The weather was warm with a breeze but as none blew in the window the room was stifling even with a fan I had to ask for a luggage rack ice bucket as none was provided I had only 1 towel for 3 nights until I requested more All in all it was a miserable stay ,NEGATIVE

 Prices in the bar were a rip off 11 25 for a glass of wine ,NEGATIVE
 The location is excellent ,POSITIVE
 The wi fi was very poor The lighting of the room was pretty bad The mini bar was extra small and was set to 12 celcius degrees so the food you wish to store could easily get spoilt They didn t help us with the storage of our food even though they said they would call us back ,NEGATIVE
 Nothing really,NEGATIVE
 The tele doesn t move off the wall can not watch this In Bed properly ,NEGATIVE

 The hotel is badly in need of renovation Staff are few and unable to manage the enormous rush during breakfast ,NEGATIVE
 Although i almost got poisoned because complimentary coffee and milk in the room was not fresh I could have given this hotel a really very high point but they have no interest in customer satisfaction which i hate the most ,NEGATIVE

 Porridge ,NEGATIVE
 Hoovering the halls at the crack of dawn ruined my lay in,NEGATIVE

 A 10min walk from the station brought us to a wonderful hotel ,POSITIVE
 The bar staff and carvery staff were lovely The blackout shutters on the window made it easier to sleep and the room was quiet ,NEGATIVE
 Could be more luxurious,POSITIVE
 On arrival we were Met with a long que to reception when we did get served we were told they didn t have a room available for us due to maintenance work They said to go to the bar for a complementary drink and they would have a taxi pick us up and take us in 10 mins An hour and half later we were still waiting I asked them to get me a room in there hotel as other people were checking in They agreed and we ended up in a basement room which was very small Tv didn t have a remote to operate it either It definatley was not a four star room or experience We had to que 30 mins to get into the breakfast room When we did get in they had no cerial bowls so we had to use dinner plates to eat fruit and yogurt They clearly were struggling to cope as the beans sausage bacon etc was all depleted at different times Worst hotel experience for us for a long time Shame as we were there for my wife s birthday ,NEGATIVE
 Lovely staff lovely welcome very nice,POSITIVE
 Fabulous Hotel and very convenient for our trip to the 02 concert venue fabulous view over the river ,POSITIVE
 Nothing,NEGATIVE
 We have been to this hotel previously and the staff were amazing but on this occasion the breakfast team leaders management outright ignored us far too busy with their own weekend catch up while waiting right next to them to ask them a question Also when asking whether drinks from the bar could be charged to our room the bar tender said we can try I m assuming it s either a yes you have the facility or a no When I asked again as I was unsure what was meant I got the same answer like I might be a bit stupid To be fair all the other staff were super friendly probably just a few letting the side down ,NEGATIVE

 The croissants were a great reason to wake up to Washroom very sleek Inviting ambience,POSITIVE
 The modern interior of the room ,POSITIVE

 The hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful The room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms I have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space I found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay At checkout time the staff were politely informed that I could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst I went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from London which was most appreciated Overall I had an enjoyable stay at the Grand Royale London Park Hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to London ,POSITIVE

 My mom and I stayed there for two nights Everything was fine until our check out We ordered a meal the night before our check out I made the payment cash because the waiter said nothing about the payment options and signed the receipt I even remember the amount of money I paid When the time has come for check out I told them about the order and payment He did not add the payment to the checkout receipt for that time When we returned home we saw that they took the money from the credit card It was not a lie I don t need to say something that didn t happen It is not a lot of money to care about but it is not the right thing to do It is not a trusting behaviour I want to say that I am very disappointed and will never prefer to stay at this hotel again ,NEGATIVE

 The only downsides to the Hotel are its location Situated a 20 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride away from Comasina Metro station on the very end of the yellow line The nearest shop is also a bus ride away and for some unknown reason to the front left and right of the hotel and actually sharing the same grounds are two very badly derelict old hotels kinda makes you remember seeing war torn Sarajevo on the news in the the 90s I m not sure why they are there but they ve both been completely stripped back to the concrete but it looks like there are no current plans to demolish them The only grumble we had was with the barman the drinks are very pricey not his fault but he was rather rude and a little disinterested to serve us and although clearly we were stood waiting he went to serve people who had walked up to the bar that second He was also rude to several other customers and walked off to serve other people whilst they were trying to order food ,NEGATIVE

 This room was not worth 200 night I believe that the Premier Inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities The amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room The wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for 2 room guests The bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force In this case it could result in that person sustaining injury I would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom ,NEGATIVE

 This was a little pricey for us so we were only staying 1 night but it was worth every penny We had a king studio room the kids had a sofa bed in the living area which was already made up ready for us we had a slight view of the London eye to the left if we had been a little higher up the view would have been amazing although we were more than happy Lovely modern bathroom and the kitchen facilities were a great bonus The breakfast had a massive choice and was mostly very good We were downstairs in the second room and it was packed but the food was hot and service fab The small children play area in the corner was a genius idea The Location was perfect for exploring London Pretty much as close to Westminster bridge as you can get and 1 min walk to the embankment with all the entertainment and bars restaurants and less than 5 mins to the underground The whole hotel was spotless very modern and fancy A real treat ,POSITIVE
