 I had a rather frustrating experience I booked the room because it came with a guaranteed view and a bathtub in reality the room looked out onto another building through dirty windows So I complained and the staff tried to be helpful upgrading me to a room with a view of the river I was so pleased until I actually got inside the room It was a family room and had two double beds in it and wasn t cosy or nice at all For a romantic getaway with my boyfriend it just all felt so wrong The bath drain didn t work so we couldn t have a bath And the toilet didn t flush properly It was supposed to be a special night away for us an anniversary and birthday celebration and ended up being rather a let down in terms of the room and facilities etc I had also called ahead twice to stress that it was a special occasion confirm that I would have a view of the river and ask for some wine glasses to be in the room which I was assured I would get and never got When I checked in I asked again and still never got wine glasses Which is just freaking annoying ,NEGATIVE,"{""sentiment"":""negative"",""key_points"":[""Booked room promised a view and bathtub, but got a view of another building"",""Staff tried to help by upgrading to a river view room"",""Upgraded room was a family room with two double beds, not cozy for a romantic getaway"",""Bath drain did not work"",""Toilet did not flush properly"",""Called ahead to confirm special occasion and request wine glasses, which were never received"",""Overall experience was a let down for anniversary and birthday celebration""],""suggestions"":""Ensure that promised amenities are provided, especially for special occasions.
