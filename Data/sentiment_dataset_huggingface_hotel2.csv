 At check in i was delighted to see the Spices Indian Restaurant and immediately made dinner plans The restaurant was very quiet and i perhaps i discovered why I ordered a glass of what purported to be Rioja and indeed it might have been but tasted like it came from a bottle which had been left half empty for days or longer On sending it back as off the waiter clearly disagreed with me but agreed to bring me a Shiraz instead which tasted remarkably similar to the supposed Rioja and similarly off So i reverted to beer and waited for the food To be fair the Masala Fish starter was ok However the lamb rogan reminded me of some sort of re constituted packet meal from the 1980s The type of meat i m assuming it was meat was indeterminate there was no evidence of spicy hotness and it was accompanied by a Peshwari Nan which had a vague sprinkling of something resembling desiccated coconut but nothing else It was without doubt one of the worst culinary experiences of my life My advice stay at the hotel but avoid the Indian restaurant ,NEGATIVE,2945,,,,

 In my first room the air conditioning didn t work only the fan was working So I asked the reception for someone to come and see it and possibly fix it I called three times within an hour or two but no one turned up After a long wait I went to the reception and asked whether anyone was coming I was told someone would come later when I m away But when I arrived late in the evening it turned out that no one had visited my room to see what s wrong with the AC So I went to the reception again and I was given another room with apologies and that was OK no complaints here But in the new room the AC wasn t working at all the switch did not even turn on When I went to the reception again it was so overwhelmed with people checking in that there was no chance to get to speak to anyone So I gave up on further fight and since the weather was getting a bit cooler I decided to live without the AC However that s not the end of it in the new room there was also a bathroom vent extremely noisy and impossible to switch off too loud to sleep at night And finally on the next night we found a half dead cockroach lying in the bathtub Photo enclosed All in all a disgrace ,NEGATIVE,3740,,,,
